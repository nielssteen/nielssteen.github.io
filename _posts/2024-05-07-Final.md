## Exploring the traffic signs of Copenhagen

Ever wondered what the road signs of Copenhagen can tell us beyond just directions? Which unknown facts about Copenhagen can be unearthed by looking at the data hidden within the very signs that litter our urban environment.
That's the question driving our project: delving into the data behind road signs. Join us as we uncover insights that could reshape how we navigate and understand our urban landscape. Ready to decode the secrets of our streets? Let's dive in.

Traffic signs are in place to protect everyone navigating traffic and ensure it is conducted effectively. Signs can tell a lot about a neighborhood and who the road users are. 
The map below shows the general placement of all signs in Copenhagen. It is clear that the denser areas such as the city center has more signs than the outskirts such as Valby or Vanløse. When diving into the map below it is also clear that the hotspots of traffic such as Nørreport or Nørrebro station has an extremely high density of signs as there are many road users that needs caring of.

It is not only the density of the signs that differ but also the types of signs that are shown are different. In the suburbs such as Valby, Vanløse and Brønshøj where the population density is lower, the streets are wider, and children more often are playing in the street rather than the yards of the apartment buildings there are relatively more local speed limit signs. In the denser city center where the stopping and parking signs are dominating.
