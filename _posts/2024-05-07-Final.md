## Exploring the traffic signs of Copenhagen

Ever wondered what the road signs of Copenhagen can tell us beyond just directions? Which unknown facts about Copenhagen can be unearthed by looking at the data hidden within the very signs that litter our urban environment.
That's the question driving our project: delving into the data behind road signs. Join us as we uncover insights that could reshape how we navigate and understand our urban landscape. Ready to decode the secrets of our streets? Let's dive in.

Traffic signs are in place to protect everyone navigating traffic and ensure it is conducted effectively. Signs can tell a lot about a neighborhood and who the road users are. 
The map below shows the general placement of all signs in Copenhagen. It is clear that the denser areas such as the city center has more signs than the outskirts such as Valby or Vanløse. When diving into the map below it is also clear that the hotspots of traffic such as Nørreport or Nørrebro station has an extremely high density of signs as there are many road users that needs caring of.

It is not only the density of the signs that differ but also the types of signs that are shown are different. In the suburbs such as Valby, Vanløse and Brønshøj where the population density is lower, the streets are wider, and children more often are playing in the street rather than the yards of the apartment buildings there are relatively more local speed limit signs. In the denser city center where the stopping and parking signs are dominating.

It is not only the activities and users on the roads that can be seen in the signs that are put up. History can also be seen in the signs. The approach to city planning has changed throughout the years. Copenhagen is an old city and for many years cars did not play a role in the city planning and the layout of roads. Roads were narrower as they did not need to fit two SUVs passing each other comfortably but rather plenty of pedestrians and maybe a couple of horse carriages. 

As cars were introduced the old city had to adapt to the new player on the road. The narrow roads had to accommodate the cars, and, in many cases, they were not designed to do that. Signs can mitigate this.

In the map below the city has been divided into a grind of 100 m by 100 m squares and the areas with the most signs are highlighted. They are all in some of the older parts of the city. Around the city center and Nørrebro.

One might argue that it also corresponds with the areas of the city where most activity is and most people floc around. But when the data is filtered to only include one-way street signs and signs showing a dead end and overlaid with a historic map of Copenhagen from 1869 it is clear that the city was designed before cars and had to be reworked.

There are many signs in the old city center and the inner part of Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Christianshavn where there also were streets 150 years ago. 
The current sign trend is pointing towards an increased focus around parking. It is a hot topic in The municipality and currently there are more cars than parking spaces in Copenhagen. It should come as no surprise that parking signs have been put up more and more often which can be seen on the plot below.

What about the future? What can we expect to see sign wise? One area that recently was redesigned and got a lot of praise for its design is the roundabout on Sejrøgade. It got remade around 2018 and alternative bike routes and much nature has been added to the area. It features a high concentration of unconditional right of way signs which forces cars and cyclists to be more aware of their surroundings as they cannot only rely on traffic signals.

The area also got some critique for feeling unsafe during night time. Meaning that the future might hold more unconditional right of way signs, more nature and more city lights.

Having gotten into the nitty gritty details of signs it would be a shame to look into whether or not they are designed to make the parking providers and police make more money by charging users of the road parking and handing out speeding fines.

Diving into the car park of Copenhagen and looking at the signs related to parking the concentration is highest in the inner part of the city. Where traffic is the heaviest.

Data on where the most parking fines are handed out is available and looking at the top five roads where most parking fines are handed out many theories can be devised. The top five roads for parking fines are placed as shown on the map below:

<iframe src="/Map6.html" height="500" width="700"></iframe>

Two roads around Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej and Juliane Maries Vej are on the list, one could image that people sometimes are in a hurry to get into the hospital to visit their loved ones and forget to pay for parking. 

Østerfarimagsgade and Nyropsgade are both busy streets close to many important places such as citizen services and doctors meaning many people might park on the streets occasionally and not know the rules and regulations for parking. 

Bådmandsgade on Christianshavn are the highscorer on number of parking fines handed out and still has no signs displaying the rules of parking in the area (marked in blue dots on the image below).

<iframe src="/Map7.html" height="500" width="700"></iframe>

The ethics of such a short street having the highest rate and no signs should be posed to the people setting up signs with parking regulations as they should get to work on that road.
Bådmandsgade is a case of making great business on poor sinage.

The same case can be seen with speeding tickets where Tagensvej, Åboulevarden, and Vigerslev Allé hold the record for most speeding tickets. They are some of the main roads used by pendlers travelling to the city center to work. And they have almost no signs indicating speed limits.

Police should be giving out tickets to ensure safe roads, but if the signage around the speeding limit was improved safer roads and fewer tickets might be a reality.

Through this exploration we have uncovered how signs can show us something about the areas and the streets we live in and spend our every days on. They can tell us about our past present and future. Can sometimes they do not tell people about speed limits or parking regulation causing drivers to get fine. There is a lot to think about the next time you see a sign.
